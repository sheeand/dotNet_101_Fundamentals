Defining Classes Exercise #1
Data Helper wants a simple app that allows them to 
create employees for a time tracking app. 

For now we want just the basics for a data layer.

We want a unique employee id number, last name, age, 
and number of total hours on the clock. 

Write tests that check to be sure that an object can 
be instantiated from this class. 

Do not use a console application for this project. 
Your unit test should verify that an object can be created.
