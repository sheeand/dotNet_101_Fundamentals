Problem 3: Sales Team 
Komodo wants to collect data for their sales teams.   
For now, they simply want to collect a sales member's last name and total sales 
for the current month.  They also want to find the following:
	1. Total sales for all members on the list.
	2. The dollar amount for the lowest sales 
	3. The dollar amount for the highest sales
	4. A list of sales team member's with the highest sales.
	5. A list of sales team member's with the lowest sales.

They do not need a console app for this, but they want some thorough Unit Testing.
