Business Problem: 
Komodo insurance wants a simple program that asks 
users their name and what
type of vehicle they have to be insured. 

Vehicles include car, boat, motorcycle, or plane. 

When the user enters a vehicle name, the console will
respond with a fixed amount for insurance for one month.  
For simplicity, we’ll handle three age ranges.

Age       Car   Boat   Motorcycle   Plane
18-27     150   200    200          1000
27-65     50    100    100          500
65+       100   150    250          1000
