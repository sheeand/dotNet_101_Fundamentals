Encapsulation Challenge #2

Challenge:

Komodo Insurance is trying to organize dimensions for their new workspace. They want to break
everything up into rectangular cubes of various sizes, and they'll have some temporary walls in place for that purpose. 
They're planning on going to a local art shop to buy art for the walls after they set them up. They'll need to have
dimensions of the rooms and the surface area of their walls for all of the work. 

They need a program that will help them do some calculations of the spaces. They need to record the length of each room, the width
of the room, and the height of each room. All rooms are between 12 feet and 10 feet tall. They don't want any spaces smaller
than 6 by 6. And they don't want any spaces bigger than 30 by 30. They also need to be able to calculate the surface area
of the walls in each room.
