Problem 4: Claim Dates
Komodo needs an application that does some claim handling.
Komodo allows an insurance claim to be made up to 30 days after an incident 
took place. If the claim is not in the proper time limit, it is not valid. 
Also, if an online claim is made for over $10,000, the policy holder should 
be redirected to a service agent via telephone. Your goal is to test 
the following:

1. Whether a claim is valid or not in terms of timespan.
2. If a claim is over $10,000, a message to call an agent is given. 
3. If a claim is under, $10,000 a message is sent that the claim is 
being processed.
