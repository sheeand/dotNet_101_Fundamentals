Komodo Insurance needs a client queue for when a client calls in
and needs some help.
When the client calls in they will need to be added to the agents queue.
The program needs to make sure the clients are assisted in the order in which they called.
They will record a message with their need.
The program will need a method that
will allow agents to peek at the next person in line to check what the client's question is in advance.
After a client has been served they will need to be
removed from the agent's workload, and the next client will be placed next on the call line.
We will need to unit test any methods. We need to build this program without a console just to provide quick proof of concept.
